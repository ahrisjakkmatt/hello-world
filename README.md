# hello-world

Hello everyone,

I am a student and new to programming, web and app development. I arrived here after journeying a silly road in chemistry labs and eventually rediscovering the beauty of programming logic, language and structure. Feel free to comment on what you see, or what I have posted publicly.

Sa√∫de,
